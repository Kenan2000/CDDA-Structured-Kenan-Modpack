We should also convince our couple of adventurers to do the same. Maybe not. No, not now. Cults, 'THEY', 'True Superiors', this fucker is still out there. Unless we get help from survivors. Maybe we have a chance to settle down, survive, live together hopefully as well",

All 4 of us should be thankful that we have even managed to survive, assemble our team again. With intel that we've learned about strange organizations' activities in New England, no doubt that bio-soldiers, mutants are again being produced by shady masterminds. The most prominent are Strange Cult, 'THEY', there are also rumors of a more discreet organization called 'True Superiors'. Considering how careful 'Alliance' is, sheer numbers of these bio-soldiers, all of this made aliens choose a safe option of allying with them.\n \n    Still, they are much weaker than pre-Cataclysm private military organizations, they are simply remnants of former ones. However, they are way too sophisticated for mere remnants. I know some altruistic remnants of organizations, they are quite advanced, but are still forced into hiding. They even rely on help from local survivors. I'm not sure if we should concentrate on restoring safety in our local areas like professional survivors, or support my partner's obsession with further investigating these ourselves, I'm confused honestly.\n \n    What I know from our allies is that survivors do fend off these bastards successfully, they even attack their structures. Even though my distrust towards these experiments is greatest compared to all of us, these scientists have shown me proof of saving survivors from dangers of The Blob, Mycus, Triffids. Clearly, BL9 is a symbiote, it's origin is not of regular bioweapons. Only because it is either easily modifiable BL9 or horrible mutations from The Blob from local water, BL9 has a potential to be safe option to protect everyone, but only provided that experiments are long-term, guarantee physical, mental safety of hosts hopefully as well",

Ah, shit, reminds me of so much we've went through with her. Two desperate survivors in these horrible conditions stuck in a city full of terrors. Love was least of my priorities back then. I worked as a police officer in my home town. As I remember, this started with me receiving my promotion of a corporal under the condition that I would move to a nearby town. I needed money, so I agreed. It was That City, one of the most horrible pre-Cataclysm cases of unsanctioned bioweapons experiments.\n \n    I was about to start my first day as a newly promoted corporal. I was being late when I've heard the sirens all across the city, evacuation helicopters recklessly getting away. On my way to police station I saw people aggressively chasing other people, leaping at them, grabbing them by their legs. They clawed them savagely then started to eat their flesh. It was horrifying and disgusting, I puked upon seeing this right in my car. Some of them saw me and ran towards my car, I pressed gas, running few of them over. I made my way to one of the closest relatively big markets.\n \n    I went to this market get supplies, also to possibly find a good melee weapon, a fire axe or a wrench. I heard a running noise from the outside towards the same door I entered. A girl armed with a revolver clumsily yet quickly entered with a shambler behind her. I aimed at it, telling her to get down. With a headshot I killed it. Then we both ran towards my car, quickly made our way out of there. She was a junior robotics engineering student in That City. Her brother was a high-ranking veteran policeman. This explained to me her being pretty good with guns",

I always found applied math, physics pretty fun. My brother, the cop in our family, approved of my decision, he is all fists and fighting, so analytical one in our family is a must. As my dear says about his first day of corporal rank experience, I felt the same way back then. Love, no. Safety, protection, yes. That's how I felt back then. My brother was missing, I was alone on the streets, searching for him, when the whole city went to shit. I ran as fast as I could to nearest building, coming across him. A guy in a police uniform, aiming his gun at me, telling me to get down. So I did, out of fear, yet he killed a shambler behind me.\n \n    We made our way in his car to police station, which, disappointingly, was also infested with these mutants. Most were shamblers, but there was this horrible type. A fleshy beast with a grotesque head, long tongue, no eyes, and long claws size of a human. We were chased by a giant brute in this building. As we were hiding from it, I found documents proving that my brother left That City weeks ago to do his private investigation. Also we found a secret underground passage in That City's police station. It was leading to some kind of a laboratory complex, which answered most of our questions in terms of what the heck even happened in That City.\n \n    This entire lab was a huge conspiracy. Unsanctioned bioweapons experiments. An incident with bioweapon leak was a result of lab's main mutated scientist going mad over his secret creation being stolen by some private military. On our way out of lab, we saved this scientist's daughter. Three of us barely made it out of there safely via an underground train system with that scientist beast and a huge brute chasing us",

This is what government told me later on. Hunter brute, horribly mutated scientist, stolen samples of bioweapons, shady female spy. That spy really did save my life multiple times, helping me to destroy this brute, but she clearly had her own motives there. Every time our paths crossed, I always knew that she had some errands to do, provided by her new employers. Whatever, we made it safe, now about events after That City essentially.\n \n    Let's just say that government has become interested in two barely trained survivors going through so much shit successfully. We've been 'offered' government agents jobs. Not much choice, considering what we've seen. Then these were times of my duty in various parts of the world. Strangely, current New England prominent factions of madmen that are obsessed with BL9 symbiote really remind me of what I've seen in Europe. Is that some kind of a bullshit trend? As years went by, I tried to convince my engineer girl to let me talk government out of her further involvement. I've been seeing more and more shit that I didn't get killed for only because I'm too useful to kill essentially.\n \n    Honey is too stubborn, she wanted to delve even deeper into this. Saving people from madmen with bioweapons is more important than building complex electromechanical systems. That's what she says. When Cataclysm happened, this tight grip was gone.

I convinced him though that our usefulness simply matters much more to them than our knowledge, as long as we have no objections to working for them. Then Cataclysm happened. Governments were gone. No united control. Only individual organizations remained. Some new, some remnants of former organizations. All have different motives.\n \n    Even though there is a lot of work we have in terms of rebuilding everything, I've convinced my dear for us to become hunters of some sorts. We investigate activities of strange local cults, military formations. If we suspect them to have not particularly friendly motives, we carefully check their structures. Usually they clearly are hostile, attack everyone on sight, however some really are altruistic. Latter are much more discreet, not because it is their intention. They achieve their goals only by communicating with, helping people. They are forced into hiding, especially in New England area because of Strange Cults, 'THEM', 'True Superiors', 'Alliance'.

I mean, pretty much everything around, The Blob, Mycus, Triffids, can be considered bioweapons, pretty much not safe for majority of people. BL9, as our allies state, can be modified, to be used as protection against other hostile microorganisms, they even have proof of this. I don't know, my brother would not agree, but if there are no alternative options. This potentially can be used as means to protect all of us, our offspring, hopefully as well",

Some have improved our lifestyle, others have advanced all of us as a civilization. But humans still remained filthy humans with their animal needs, failing to see the bigger picture of what humans are truly capable of. However, one particular discovery, that later led to an invention, gave some a chance to evolve from this filthy state of animals. I was one of such who was worthy of this evolution. I started to see the bigger picture. I obediently followed my benefactors, learned from them, made temporary friends, who proved to be incredibly useful in terms of knowledge they shared in field of bioweapons research.\n \n    Even though our organization made a lot of progress, that was not without curious feeble beings, limited by ethics, shoving their noses into what was beyond their comprehension. Not being a public figure in our organization, I was sent as a double agent to police department that was responsible for investigations related to one of our properties. Plan was simple, lure them into a trap in one of our mansions they intended to investigate. That plan failed, though, it was not mine in first place. When our weaker subjects failed to kill these two fuckers, I've decided to take on them myself, obviously, with help of one of our sophisticated creations. That failed, fuckers proved to be too stubborn, however, experience is what I've gained from this.\n \n    This failure brought a lot of unwanted attention to our organization. It needed to be restructured. So it was. My temporary friend, main scientist in our lab of That City, was given an order to accelerate development of new bioweapon. However, his views started to change. There were disagreements with his superiors. His own pride and foolishness gave me an advantage. Seeing my high intelligence, knowledge that I've gained from this 'friend' of mine, I've managed to convince my benefactor to forcefully acquire samples of newest bioweapon that my 'friend' has made in That City",
