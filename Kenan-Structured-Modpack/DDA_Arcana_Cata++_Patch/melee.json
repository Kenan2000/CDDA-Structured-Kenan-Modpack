    "description": "A band of steel worn over the knuckles, etched with strange markings.  Salvaged from a CBM.  When used as an unarmed weapon, it can give your strikes the ability to send victims flying, with amplified damage and armor penetration.  Its impacts have a chance of letting loose a blinding flashbang effect, making this weapon a double-edged sword without protection.",
