A while ago I was going through old merge/pull requests on github and just seeing what was or wasn't added etc and I stumbled upon these files.

These files were created by github user LyleSY who instead of uploading this as a mod tried to get it mainlined which it never did. It added dinos to forests as well as full dino evolution with breeding, eggs and baby dinos.

Probably horribly imbalanced, and I've read that breeding in the game can get out of control so I've only included the forest spawns and egg files, that way you can still stumble across an egg, but it won't evolve, it's just more food.

Included is the dinosaur json he made as an rtf file for anyone who wants to work on it and experiment.

To install just copy the json files into the dinomod folder.
