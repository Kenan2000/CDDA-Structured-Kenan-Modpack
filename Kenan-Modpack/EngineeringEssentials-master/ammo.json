    "description": "Small rod made of dense plastic with thin metal layer on the rear side. Could be used as a projectile by a railgun-type electromagnetic weapon. When fired, conductive layer is turned into plasma coating, pushing the projectile forward. Because of even higher projectile speed compared to metal railgun ammo, can cause devastating damage to unarmored target, but has much shorter range and ineffective against armored targets.",
