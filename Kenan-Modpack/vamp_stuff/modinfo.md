## NPCs
These are the friendly NPCs that interacts with you.

Vampire NPCs are beneficial for their eternal experience in combat, survival and communication skills. With wrong doings, these "skills" may test out onto you.

### Missions
Every mission is simple and self-explanatory, intended to provide players with RPG-ish feeling. Completing missions will provide features furthermore, such as *unlocking*(revealing) new areas and obtaining useful items.

## Scenarios
Scenarios that spices up your taste in starting to venture the world. Currently a stub.

##### Vampire Wannabe
This scenario will put yourself on a test as you start being surrounded by a mob of ravenous zeds outside your LMOE shelter. Below are the listed professions for this.
* costs: 1 point - *Vampire Freak* starts with low level communication and survival skills, while the rest is similar to the evacuee profession.
* costs: 12 points - *So-called Vampire* is rather an overpowered profession in this scenario. It starts with high combat skills (mainly melee) and a set of light survivor armor.

Starting your journey with this scenario gives you a point of direction...

## Magic Spells
Vampiric spells have mixed variety, and most of them are not suitable for the demise of a critter. There are spells that affect the target's mobility, there are spells that curses, however, few are deadly with just a simple gesture of an arm. With humans taking steps into the depths of magic, these spells were eventually discovered.

With spells being part of **Vampiric Stuff** mod, the built-in mod - **Magiclysm** - is suggested to be activated along with it. (though it wasn't listed as a dependency)

There are 3 spellcaster classes, listed descending as how aggresive the class is:
* **Warlock** - Caster that conjure spells for as long as it can. All of its spell uses mana, limited to status, but more on dealing damage. Unique prowess of a warlock is to call forth ancient idols.
* **Profane Conjurer** - Caster that conjure profane elements. Similar to warlock, it consumes large amount of mana. Most of its spell inflicts status ailments that deals damage. Unique prowess of a profane conjurer is the ability to manipulate spectacular bursts of unholy elements. It's like kelvinist, but edgy.
* **Hemomancer** - Caster that revolves on life force manipulation; more on a give-and-take type caster. Uses most of its spell with life force in inflicting both status ailments and damage, while few consumes mana. Unique prowess of a hemomancer is the ability to obtain forms.

These spellcaster types conflict with each other, i.e: learning _**Clot**_ locks you out of *Profane Conjurer* and *Warlock*, because that spell belongs to the **Hemomancer**.

Spells have tier levels. A tier level tells you how strong, efficient or rare the spell is.
