    "description": "Adds the ability to have sex with NPCs, with a romantic path as an option as well. Pregnancy is also a thing but only in item form due to some limitations I've run into. The end pregnancy item will spawn in a baby human entity that you'll have to keep alive as it grows up, until eventually you're given an item via the last stage to spawn an npc of the offspring class that don't have any checks for following you so they're basically a guaranteed ally.",
