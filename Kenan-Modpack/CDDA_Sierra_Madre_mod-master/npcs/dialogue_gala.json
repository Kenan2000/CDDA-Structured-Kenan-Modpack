The Gala Event, the grand opening of the Sierra Madre Casino, you are the ones who have made this momentous occasion possible, and for that we thank you. So raise your glass in celebration, let music fill the streets, fireworks light the sky and promise of new beginnings fill your hearts. No matter what your fortune, no matter what your cares -- let go this night and begin again. I suggest you hurry, though; the gates of Sierra Madre are open but only for a brief time.
