    "description": "The state-of-tech steak knife made out of advanced steel alloys developed at Big Mountain research facility shortly before the apocalypse. Makes an excellent weapon, to the point you wonder who and how at Big Mountain made a mistake of designing it as a civilian steak knife before introducing it to the military as a new combat knife. It has been poisoned with the venom made out of the Sierra Madre Cloud and thanks to it will poison your enemies, dealing additional damage over time.",
