--Both this mod and Artyoms' Gun Emporium can be used at the same time. I tried to stay away from the firearms that Artyom used in his Artyoms' Gun Emporium mod. Although, I made three exceptions: the AutoMag, the Browning Hi Power (because I have a personal connection to both of these guns,) and the FX-05 Xiuhcoatl, (because it is a HK G36 clone and I did additional work on tweaking the HK G36.) 
 
The game loads mods from top to bottom on the mods list when creating a world. If you place this mod above Artyoms' mod, on that list, then you can continue to use Artyoms' version of these three weapons. 
 
There will be, if both this mod and Artyom's mod are used, some mags that may not have a weapon with which to load, because I did not coordinate my mags with his mags and he, obviously, could not have used mine.
