Thing is, some of the scenery from these dreams looked familiar, and after zero day I started poring over some local maps to try and make sense of what little looked real.

I have occasionally visited the local refugee center to trade for essential tools and supplies, but I will be needed here for the time being, and the others have been busy gathering supplies and continuing construction.  We have arrangements made for delivery of supplies, but every so often we have to send inventory of what we need and what we have to offer.  Could you simply deliver this to their merchant, and return the receipt they usually write up?",
      "accepted": "Thank you.  The merchant requires an advance payment, surplus scavenged supplies or precious metal.  This should be sufficient to complete the arrangement, we use these to set aside measured amounts of material for repairing our equipment.  With your help we'll be able to focus our efforts on making this place livable, and once the trade is settled that'll give us more breathing room.  Hopefully by the time supplies start running low again, we'll have a few more of us around to take care of ourselves.",

If you can retrieve that infernal weapon in your hunt, we will be able to destroy it safely.  I would commit a full hunting party if only we could spare anyone.  Dii vult!",

Truth is, early on when shit hit the fan I picked up a few books and some other experience with all this strangeness.  Not much, but enough to keep me another day away from dying.  I used to help tend to crops, these new experiences and some of the weird creatures I've seen gave me an idea for something that might improve crop yields.  Interested?",
      "accepted": "Alright.  Truth is, it's a bit dangerous hunting those monsters out there.  The big walking plants, making nests burrowed underground.  When I went to Ms. McKinnon with the idea she said she'd keep an eye out for any leads.  I'll give you directions to a local hotspot she got wind of from her scouts.  If you visit it, keep an eye out for the ones with bright red flowers, that can raise hell growing plants like wildfire.  I need the flower itself.",

I can use what I've learned, and a little help from her, to liven up the compound here and grow a few things, but it seems it'll take a lot of energy plus burn out whatever force is still present in these petals.  They have away to weave its effects into someone's very being so they don't need to hunt monsters, but that just makes it drain energy out of whoever uses it instead.  Still, thank you for the help, should have the finishing touches ready right quick.",
