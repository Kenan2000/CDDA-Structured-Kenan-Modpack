# Mutation-Changes-Mod-Fix-
Its basically Mutation Changes Mod from Peeved Penguin but fixed, so it can run without problems in the newer versions. I Don't intend to steal anyone's project and will remove the link if the author wish it so. Also this is the first thing i have modded for cataclysm and i did it with the best intentions so... Please dun' kill me... :(

-Ok also something you need to be aware is that... In order to get the chimerical protection mutation, you will have to mod your the json files of your cataclysm to make it so, that all the fur/feathers/scale mutations not cancel between themselves out (and it isn't so ilogical if you see it, because mother nature is veeeeery weird so if the conditions are right the life can develop strange thing to cope up with the situations presented, either developing fin wings in water or both scales and feathers in the prehistory.) its not so hard if you use the search/replace commands. 

-Also there are still a bit of problems with the mod, But i personally think it isn't that bad... Oh well here it is. The mod won't download itself from cdda launcher because... Of things... Don't look at me like that it's the first time i do these things, and i don't know everything, But going back to the point... You can do a manual download to the mod, if you don't know how to do that (which is very unlikely...) it's very easy just create a folder in the "mods" folder, (if the mod's contents aren't in a folder already) name it with the mod's name, and put the content of the mod there, if the mod is compressed and its already in a folder just drag it to the "mods" folder which its inside the "data" folder and boom there you have it, just create a new world load it aaaand... i realized that you may already know this and i am just losing my time Yay! ... Nah! Just kidding ;3.
