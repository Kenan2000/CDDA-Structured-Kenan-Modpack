subtitle: {{$:/core/images/info-button}} The field "<<name>>" changed

\rules except wikilink

You changed the field "<<name>>" from "<<oldValue>>" to "<<newValue>>".

It is recommended to let TiddlyMap copy all values from the former field "<<oldValue>>" to the new field "<<newValue>>" so the data stored in "<<oldValue>>" is not lost. This operation has to be done now or never.

Do you want to move each tiddler's existing "<<oldValue>>" value to "<<newValue>>"? Please note that any value currently stored in "<<newValue>>" would consequently be overridden and the old field "<<oldValue>>" would be eventually removed!
