  "A bionic that creates a disruptive energy that conceals the user's life force, rendering them undetectable to the undead, at the cost of steadily sickening the body and attracting hostility from natural wildlife.": "一种仿生生物，它创造出一种破坏性的能量，隐藏使用者的生命力，使其无法被亡灵察觉，其代价是不断地使身体生病，并吸引来自自然野生动物的敌意。",
  "Sanguine Mark\nUsing this spell will summon a dark wyrm.  Whether it will obey you is completely up to chance.": "鲜血之印记\n使用这个咒语将召唤一个黑暗的幽灵。它是否会服从你完全取决于机会。",

  "Several strips of silver inlaid along the length of a firearm's barrel, and a peculiar device wired to each inlay.  When catalyzed by charge from a UPS, the anomalous energies conducted through the inlay imbue bullets with abnormal effects.  Can't be installed on a sawed-down barrel.\nThis device amplifies and shapes the thermal energy given off by the burning powder of each shot, channeled into the bullet to create a plume of plasma.  While this adds a boost to lethality, it comes at the cost of accuracy and range, potentially rendering the weapon unusable.": "沿着枪管的长度嵌有几条银条，每个镶嵌物上都有一个特殊的装置。当由UPS的电荷催化时，通过嵌体传导的异常能量会使子弹产生异常效果。不能安装在锯下的桶上。\n这个装置放大和塑造每一发子弹燃烧的火药所释放的热能，引导到子弹中，形成一股等离子体羽流。虽然这增加了杀伤力，但它以精度和射程为代价，有可能使武器无法使用。",

  "A handloaded shotgun shell, loaded with silver pellets and blessed with salt.  The addition of consecrated essence enhances its impact and turns each pellet into a mote of white-hot light when fired.  Immolates targets on impact and bypasses mundane armor, while leaving behind a dazzling glow.": "一个装有手枪的弹壳，里面装满了银弹丸和盐。圣化精华的加入增强了它的冲击力，并使每个弹丸在发射时变成一团白热的光点。在撞击中牺牲目标并绕过普通的盔甲，同时留下耀眼的光芒。",
  "A strange liquid that looks like mercury, albeit quite a bit less dense and significantly less toxic.  Drinking it will imbue you with magical energy.  Highly useful to someone who uses mana for spells, but worthless to someone limited to fatigue-draining Magic Signs.  It will restore 1200 mana.": "一种奇怪的液体，看起来像水银，虽然密度小一些，毒性也很小。喝了它会给你注入神奇的能量。对那些使用法力施法的人非常有用，但对那些只限于疲劳消耗魔法符号的人来说毫无价值。恢复1200点法力。",

  "Several strips of silver inlaid along the length of a firearm's barrel, and a peculiar device wired to each inlay.  When catalyzed by charge from a UPS, the anomalous energies conducted through the inlay imbue bullets with abnormal effects.  Can't be installed on a sawed-down barrel.\nThis device creates a powerful spatial anomaly, forcing a tiny sliver of each projectile to undergo nuclear fission, at a penalty to accuracy and recoil.  While it's a far cry from a mininuke, the explosive force generated is complete overkill, and each spatial distortion risks tearing the fabric of reality.": "沿着枪管的长度嵌有几条银条，每个镶嵌物上都有一个特殊的装置。当由UPS的电荷催化时，通过嵌体传导的异常能量会使子弹产生异常效果。不能安装在锯下的桶上。\n这个装置产生了一个强大的空间异常，迫使每个弹丸的一小部分发生核裂变，以精确性和反冲为代价。虽然它与小型核弹相去甚远，但产生的爆炸力完全是致命的，每一次空间扭曲都有可能撕裂现实的结构。",
