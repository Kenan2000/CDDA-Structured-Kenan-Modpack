  "When first building this Villa, this Casino, I meant it for you. As the world seemed to race headlong towards war, it became part of my desire to protect you. The loans, the funding I poured into the casino's construction... I knew it would not matter when war came for us. It was my means of creating a shelter, a defense if the world was bombarded in radiation and bombs. When Dean revealed his plans inadvertently through our introduction, I realized what had happened, and how I had been tricked. For a time, my thoughts were dark. I changed the casino vault from a shelter to a trap, as I knew the first one to enter would be Dean. He would die down here, and it would have been by his own hand. I fear, however, that I overstepped myself, and the only safe place in the casino is the Vault. I have tried to rewire the systems, change the protocols, and I cannot. I will do one last check on the pipes by the edge of the outside platform and see if anything can be done. I fear it is useless. If you come down here, do not access my personal accounts entry. It contains only a message for Dean, and it will seal the door and you will have no way out - even the elevator is designed to automatically return when the door is closed, and it will lock in place. There should be enough in the Vault to sustain you until help arrives. I have ensured that there is enough medical supplies down here to keep you comfortable. The holograms should defend the casino from any attackers, and the hologram beacon in the Villa will broadcast an emergency signal so that others know you are here. When danger has passed, rescue will come. I hope you were able to read this, and know that I loved you, Frederick Sinclair.": "当我第一次建造这个别墅，这个赌场的时候，我是为你准备的。当这个世界似乎一头栽向战争的时候，我的愿望之一就是保护你。贷款，我投入赌场建设的资金。。。我知道战争什么时候来临并不重要。这是我创造一个庇护所的手段，如果世界受到辐射和炸弹的轰炸，这是一种防御。当迪恩通过我们的介绍无意中透露了他的计划时，我意识到发生了什么，以及我是如何被欺骗的。有一段时间，我的思想是黑暗的。我把赌场的金库从一个庇护所改成了一个陷阱，因为我知道第一个进去的是迪恩。他会死在这里，那是他亲手造成的。不过，我担心自己越界了，赌场里唯一安全的地方就是金库。我试过重新连接系统，改变协议，但我做不到。我再检查一下外面平台边上的管子，看看能不能做点什么。恐怕没用。如果你来这里，不要进入我的个人账户。它只包含一条给迪恩的信息，它会封住门，你就没有出路了——甚至电梯设计成在门关上时自动返回，它会锁定到位。保险库里应该有足够的东西支撑你直到救援到来。我保证这里有足够的医疗用品让你舒服。全息图应该保护赌场免受任何攻击者的攻击，而别墅中的全息图信标将广播紧急信号，以便其他人知道你在这里。危险过去了，救援就来了。我希望你能读到这篇文章，并且知道我爱你，弗雷德里克·辛克莱。",

  "EXPERIMENTAL TANKS TO ENTER FIELD TESTS - A press release yesterday from the Department of Defense has confirmed plans for a series of field tests for a new model of light tank, currently designated the XM7 Tankette.  A major departure from previous armor doctrine, the experimental design features a long-range electric engine and a state-of-the-art autoloader, recently upgraded to fit a 120mm main gun.  Most notable was the confirmation of a one-man crew compartment, with mention of advanced fire control and sensors rendering a commander and gunner unnecessary.  According to General Dabrowski, \"These aren't expected to replace the venerable Abrams, instead we're expecting them to find a new niche for urban warfare.  We're hoping in about a year these will cost a fourth as much as an Abrams to produce while having the same level of firepower.  For the same number of soldiers it'd take to crew one tank, we could have four of these all supporting each other, each monitoring the situation and calling in targets.\"": "美国国防部昨天发布的新闻稿证实了一种新型轻型坦克（目前命名为XM7坦克）的一系列实地测试计划。这一实验设计与以往的装甲理论有很大不同，它采用了远程电动发动机和最先进的自动装弹机，最近升级为可装120毫米主炮。最值得注意的是确认了一个人的乘员舱，并提到了先进的火力控制和传感器，使指挥官和枪手成为不必要的。根据达布罗夫斯基将军的说法，“人们并不指望这些战机能取代艾布拉姆斯，相反，我们希望他们能为城市战争找到一个新的阵地。我们希望在大约一年内，这些将花费四分之一的艾布拉姆斯生产，同时拥有同等水平的火力。对于一辆坦克的乘员人数相同的士兵来说，我们可以有四个这样的人互相支援，每个人都在监视局势并召唤目标。”",

  "ROBOT TANK UNVEILED - A recent press conference has confirmed the latest development in AI-driven defense systems.  Much of the details remain classified, other than the new project having only recently entered early testing.  \"We've refined some of the developments that went into the XM7 Tankette to fit an even more compact package.\" says the update, in reference to the experimental light tank program to see increased production and formal adoption in the coming months.  \"We're exploring uncharted territory with the autonomous fire control, nothing we've put into use so far has handled anything as large as a tank cannon.  Once we have all the kinks worked out we'll proceed with the next wave of trials.  We should have a working dual-core AI ready by the end of the year that can handle both the main gun and an M2 Browning, but for now we're focusing on the main gun.\"": "机器人坦克亮相——最近的一次新闻发布会证实了人工智能驱动防御系统的最新发展。除了最近才进入早期测试的新项目外，大部分细节仍然保密。”我们已经改进了XM7 Tankette的一些开发，以适应一个更紧凑的包。“更新说，在参考实验轻坦克计划，看到增加产量和正式采用在未来几个月。”我们正在探索未知领域的自主火力控制，迄今为止，我们投入使用的任何武器都不能像坦克大炮那样大。一旦我们解决了所有的问题，我们将进行下一波的试验。我们应该在年底前准备好一个可以工作的双核AI，它可以同时处理主炮和M2 Browning，但目前我们的重点是主炮。”",

Like all other flesh vessels, it requires the wearer to feed it with flesh.\n\nSecronom exoskeleton type \"Vessel (Gunner)\" provides:\n<color_white>Perception: <color_light_green>+4</color>\nSight range: <color_light_green>+10%</color>\nMetabolism: <color_light_green>-5%</color></color>": "利用最新技术进步而产生的一种复杂的战斗服。Secronom外骨骼型“血管（炮手）”是标准血管的分支变异，具有较小的肌膜和蹼以换取更大的感知。它的身体定位是建立在处理几个射弹射击武器，并迅速形成一个炮手创造。因此，它是理想的中远程作战。像所有其他的肉质血管一样，它需要佩戴者用肉来喂养它。\n\n Secronom外骨骼类型“Vessel（Gunner）”提供：\n<color\\u white>感知：<color\\u light\\u green>+4<color>",

  "Force = Mass x Acceleration.  This is the typical thing that people think of nowadays when the word is used, but Force Mages have a different meaning, coming from traditional roots: untyped magical damage appears to be a ghostly \"force.\"  This might be the effect of the attunement, but the cause is even more intriguing: they appear to turn Newton's Third Law on its head.  Magical scholars of the 21st century have theorized that this isn't really the case; instead of the opposite reaction happening on this plane of existence, a Force Mage uses the Aetherium's alternate Laws to rebound the force back upon itself, effectively doubling the force in the same direction instead.  However this ability comes with limitations, as the Force Mage can only do this for melee damage.": "力=质量x加速度。这是现在人们使用这个词时想到的典型现象，但力法师有不同的含义，来自传统的根源：非类型的魔法伤害似乎是一种幽灵般的“力”。这可能是调音的效果，但原因更有趣：他们似乎把牛顿第三定律颠倒过来了。21世纪的魔法学者们认为事实并非如此；一个原力法师没有在这个存在的平面上发生相反的反应，而是使用了埃瑟里姆的交替法则来将原力反弹回自己身上，实际上是在同一方向将原力加倍。但是这种能力有一定的局限性，因为原力法师只能对近战伤害这么做。",
