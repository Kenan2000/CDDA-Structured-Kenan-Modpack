  "original": "EXPERIMENTAL TANKS TO ENTER FIELD TESTS - A press release yesterday from the Department of Defense has confirmed plans for a series of field tests for a new model of light tank, currently designated the XM7 Tankette.  A major departure from previous armor doctrine, the experimental design features a long-range electric engine and a state-of-the-art autoloader, recently upgraded to fit a 120mm main gun.  Most notable was the confirmation of a one-man crew compartment, with mention of advanced fire control and sensors rendering a commander and gunner unnecessary.  According to General Dabrowski, \"These aren't expected to replace the venerable Abrams, instead we're expecting them to find a new niche for urban warfare.  We're hoping in about a year these will cost a fourth as much as an Abrams to produce while having the same level of firepower.  For the same number of soldiers it'd take to crew one tank, we could have four of these all supporting each other, each monitoring the situation and calling in targets.\"",

Officials refused to clarify the purpose of this rearmament program, leaving speculation that the move is an unintentional confirmation of an impending Chinese invasion.  According to an anonymous source within the military, \"They don't expect them to be facing Type 96 or 99 tanks.  They'll likely be used to engage IFVs such as the Type 08 or the Type 15 light tank.\"",

Once we have all the kinks worked out we'll proceed with the next wave of trials.  We should have a working dual-core AI ready by the end of the year that can handle both the main gun and an M2 Browning, but for now we're focusing on the main gun.\"",
